    <h2>About the Artist</h2>

    <div class="section">
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Irene Yoon. In 2017, I served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at the Seoul Korea temple as a single senior missionary, where I welcomed and assisted temple patrons in their temple worship and service. I had the privilege of living on the temple grounds during my mission, and I immediately fell in love with the Seoul Korea temple and its gardens. In my spare time, I would often take photos or draw the temple and its flowers. I also tried my hand at painting the temple, with varying degrees of success.</p> 
        
        <p>After my mission, I returned to Canada, where I was born and raised, and then for the next several months, I traveled to Utah, China, and Japan and took drawing and painting classes. Eventually I returned to Korea and again spent a lot of time at the temple, drawing and taking photos. I also took Korean folk art painting classes and tried painting the flowers from the temple gardens.</p>

         <p>For the first few years, my art focused mainly on the Seoul Korea temple and its flowers. But lately, I’ve been focusing on how much the temple means to our ancestors.</p>

         <p>My previous art and some temple photos may be seen at: https://seethetemple.wordpress.com/</p>

         <p>Most of my photos of the Seoul Korea temple are at: https://www.instagram.com/seoulkoreatemple/</p>

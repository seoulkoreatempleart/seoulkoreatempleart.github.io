<div class="entry">

  <div class="scripture">
    "And it must needs be that the devil should tempt the children of men, or they could not be agents unto themselves; for if they never should have bitter they could not know the sweet—"
D&C 29:39
  </div>
  <div class="reference"></div>

  <div class="thought">
    
    <p>Bitter because they would choose wrong. Sweet because they eventually choose right through repentance and through strength in the atoning power of Jesus Christ</p>

    <p>From <em>Temptation</em>, by Elder Rulon G. Craven: As eternal beings living this earthly experience, we will not be free from temptation. Temptation implies an inner struggle to do that which is right. The person who thinks continually in a sensual and carnal manner cannot undergo inner spiritual development. His or her sensual thinking prevents spiritual growth.</p>

    <p>Elder George Q. Cannon said: “Unless [individuals] were exposed to temptation they never could know themselves, their own powers, their own weaknesses nor the power of God. If Satan had no power to tempt mankind, they would be in a state where they could neither know good nor evil; they could not know happiness nor misery. All their powers would lie dormant, for there would be nothing to arouse them. They would be destitute of that experience which prepares men to become like God, their Eternal Father” (Gospel Truth, sel. Jerreld L. Newquist, 2 vols. in 1 [1987], 109).</p>

<p>With each right choice we make, we spiritually empower ourselves. The accumulation of right choices builds inner spiritual strength and divine character. We should expect temptation, for without temptations there would be little education and little character improvement.

  <!-- Scripture 1 -->
  <div class="scripture">
  "But the fruit of the Spirit is...temperance..." Galatians 5:22-23</div>

  <!-- Scripture 2 (optional — delete if not needed) -->
  <div class="scripture">
  "I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things." Alma 7:23
</div>

  <!-- Thoughts -->
  <div class="thought">
<p>From Kent D. Watson's talk, <em>Being Temperate in All Things,</em> Oct 2009 General Conference: [T]emperance is a divine attribute of Jesus Christ...<strong>Learning to be temperate in all things is a spiritual gift available through the Holy Ghost.</strong></p>

<p>Tempered glass, like tempered steel, undergoes a well-controlled heating process which increases strength. Thus, when tempered glass is under stress, it will not easily break into jagged shards that can injure.</p>

<p>Likewise, <strong>a temperate soul-one who is humble and full of love-is also a person of increased spiritual strength</strong>. With increased spiritual strength, we are able to develop self-mastery and to live with moderation. We learn to control, or temper, our anger, vanity, and pride...</p>

<p>Security for our families comes from learning self-control, avoiding the excesses of this world, and being temperate in all things...</p>

<p>What better example do we have of temperance than our Savior, Jesus Christ?</p>
<p>When others are unkind, Jesus taught that <em>my kindness shall not depart from thee</em>.</p>
<p>When we are confronted with affliction, He said: <em>Be patient in afflictions, revile not against those that revile. Govern your house in meekness, and be steadfast.</em></p>
<p>When we are oppressed, we can be comforted in knowing <em>he was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth.</em>[and] <em>Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows.</em></p>
<p>When Jesus Christ, the greatest of all, suffered for us to the extent that He bled from every pore, He did not express anger or revile in suffering. With unsurpassed self-restraint, or temperance, His thoughts were not of Himself but of you and of me. And then, in humility and full of love, He said, <em>Nevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.</em></p>
<p>How can I receive the gift of temperance that is extended to me? Understanding the body that the Lord has given me provides me a key.</p>

<p>In neurological terms, <strong>a calm and strong prefrontal cortex (PFC) is essential for exercising temperance</strong>, or, in other words, resisting temptation. This is one of the clearest findings in modern neuroscience.</p>
    
<p>The prefrontal cortex is responsible for: self-control, moral judgment, delaying gratification, planning, discipline, resisting impulses, and choosing long-term good over short-term pleasure.</p>

<p>2 ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS FOR A WELL-FUNCTIONING PFC</p>

<ul>
  <li>it must be calm</li>
  <li>it must be strong</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To function properly</strong>, the PFC needs:</p>

<ul class="checklist">
  <li><strong>✔ Serotonin</strong> (for stability, calm, patience, emotional regulation)<br>
      <em>Low serotonin = weak PFC</em>
  </li>

  <li><strong>✔ Healthy dopamine</strong><br>
      Motivation, drive, ability to follow through.<br>
      Healthy dopamine strengthens the PFC.
  </li>

  <li><strong>✔ Low cortisol</strong><br>
      Stress chemicals shut down the PFC.
  </li>

  <li><strong>✔ Adequate GABA</strong><br>
      Quieting of emotional storms so the PFC can take over.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Conditions that weaken the PFC and <strong>make temperance harder to exercise:</strong><br>
PMS, exhaustion, hunger, emotional overwhelm, anxiety, low serotonin, stress, poor sleep, depression.
</p>

<p><strong>Holier, higher habits work!</strong><br>
These practices:</p>

<ul>
  <li>gratitude</li>
  <li>hymns</li>
  <li>thinking of Christ</li>
  <li>deep breathing</li>
  <li>remembering God’s goodness</li>
  <li>prayer</li>
  <li>scripture study</li>
</ul>

<p>
… all increase serotonin, dopamine, GABA, and oxytocin, helping to reactivate the PFC.<br>
I can literally “reboot” or jumpstart the brain circuits that resist temptation.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Practically speaking,</strong> in addition to consistently practicing the habits listed above, to make PFC “muscle memory” grow and make bigger challenges easier to surmount:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Treat every small act of self-control as a “training session” — consistency matters
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoid thinking “it doesn’t matter” for small temptations — small wins add up over time and build momentum, eventually making it easier to resist strong temptations, even if the small act of self-control is unrelated to the big temptation
  </li>
  <li>
    Pause before habitual indulgences (scrolling, browsing, snacking) and decide intentionally
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>2 CAVEATS</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    General self-control helps, but specific “muscle memory” for that temptation matters. Even if I have strong self-control in other areas, that doesn’t automatically transfer to a specific large temptation unless the habit of resisting that type of temptation is well-practiced.
  </li>
  <li>
    The PFC engages best when I recognize a situation as requiring self-control. If I don't perceive something as a temptation or a potential risk, my PFC may not jump into action. Awareness is critical.
  </li>
</ol>

<div class="entry">

  <div class="scripture">
    "The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are <strong>bold</strong> as a lion." Proverbs 28:1
  </div>
  <div class="reference"></div>

  <div class="scripture">
    "<strong>Trust</strong> in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding." Proverbs 3:5
  </div>
  <div class="reference"></div>

  <div class="thought">
    I came across a commentary on Bible Hub that listed traits of righteousness: faith, integrity, generosity, truthful speech, and courage. I was really intrigued by the inclusion of 'courage.' I looked up the scripture referenced for 'courage,' which was Proverbs 28:1, "the righteous are bold as a lion." The word translated as 'bold,' or <em>batach</em> in Hebrew, is translated as 'trust' elsewhere. For example, Proverbs 3:5, Trust in the Lord with all thine heart.

    <p>This is the commentary from Bible Hub on <em>batach</em>:</p>

    <p>"The verb <strong><em>בָּטח</em></strong> expresses placing one’s full weight upon someone or something with calm assurance. Across the canon it always concerns an object of reliance—whether the covenant LORD, military strength, idols, political alliances, or oneself. The moral value of <em><strong>בָּטח</strong></em> is therefore determined by its object: when directed toward God it is faith, when toward anything else it is folly.</p>

    <p>Approximately one-third of the occurrences appear in Psalms...</p>

    <p>Because the covenant God commits Himself to His people, trusting Him becomes the appropriate human response. Lack of <em><strong>בָּטח</strong></em> toward the LORD is interpreted as covenant breach (Isaiah 30:1–3)."</p>

    <p>Elder Dale G. Renlund says:</p>

    <p>"When we consider the goodness of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, our <strong>trust</strong> in Them increases. ...By acknowledging that every good thing comes from Jesus Christ...[w]e will have <strong>courage</strong> when confronted with seemingly impossible tasks and circumstances" (emphasis added, "Consider the Goodness and Greatness of God," Apr 2020 GC).</p>

    <p>In the Psalms, David was often reflecting on God's goodness and mercy. Acknowledging that every good thing comes from Jesus Christ and considering the goodness of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ increases our ability to <em>batach</em>, to be bold and trust in the Lord and Heavenly Father.</p>

    <p>Seeing the definition for bold made my brain expand. I felt like I was seeing or understanding my true self for the first time. I had the beginning of an inkling of what it truly meant to be a daughter of God.</p>

    <p>Being bold means have confidence because of my trust in the Lord. Being valiant comes as a consequence of putting my full weight on the Lord. He is the object of my reliance, not money or other people.</p>
